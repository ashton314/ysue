#+title: Ysue

ysue - You Should be Using Emacs

* Synopsis

Building:

#+begin_src bash
  stack build
#+end_src

Running the program once =ysue= is on your =PATH=:

#+begin_src bash
  ysue              -- open up an empty buffer
  ysue <FILENAME>   -- edit a file
#+end_src

* Description

Ysue (/yoo/-sway) is a simple text editor implemented in Haskell. Of course, if you intend to do serious text editing, You Should be Using Emacs instead.

* Using

TODO

* Implementation

Ysue uses a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_(data_structure)][rope]] under the hood to manage arbitrary insertions/deletions into a long string of text.

I ran some benchmarks comparing how a rope vs. a naïve string implementation handle a series of random edits. Results:

* Contributing and Reporting Bugs

This is not a serious project. Really—go use Emacs, Vim, Nano, etc. instead. This is a project for a class and an exercise for me in functional programming in unusual contexts.

If you find a bug, you can report it on the [[https://codeberg.org/ashton314/ysue/issues][issue tracker on Codeberg]]. Better yet, if you have a pull request, either open it [[https://codeberg.org/ashton314/ysue/pulls][on Codeberg]] or fork the project to whatever forge you use, and send me an email at [[mailto:codeberg@wiersdorf.dev][codeberg@wiersdorf.dev]].
